This project uses data from the Formula SAE Tire Test Consortium (FSAE TTC), collected at the Calspan Tire Research Facility (TIRF).

It also uses [natsort.m](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47434-natural-order-filename-sort) from the MATLAB file exchange.

To run, run the installer in releases. The project isn't finished and still has some errors.
